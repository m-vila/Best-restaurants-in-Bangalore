# Best-restaurants-in-Bangalore

**The Dataset:**
For this analysis, I chose the following [dataset from Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/himanshupoddar/zomato-bangalore-restaurants).

**The Business Case:**

A client X has hired us to do some business analysis of the restaurant offer in Bangalore, India. The client is interested in opening a new restaurant and is open in terms of the theme and the type (food chain/ fancy restaurant). X just wants it to be different and, of course, successful. 

**The Approach:**
    
In order to determine the formula for success I researched the general trends from highly rated restaurants (affordable and expensive ones).
Did they offered online order? Where were they located? Which food did they offered? What is their cost?

**The Conclusions:**

**General trends from the restaurants**

    1) Most of the restaurants offer online order (59%)
    2) The majority of restaurants do not offer the possibility to book a table (87.5%)
    3) Almost 50% of restaurants has rating between 3 and 4.
    4) Restaurants having rating more than 4.5 are very rare.
    5) The top 5 preferred cuisines are: North Indian, Chinese, South Indian & Biryani
    6) The average cost for 2 pax is 555. Which means that there are more cheap restaurants than expensive ones.
    7) The top 5 neighborhoods with restaurants are: BTM, Koramangala 7th, 5th, 4th & 6th Block
    8) It looks like there is a moderate correlation between average_cost and rates and votes, which is expected. 
    There is a strong correlation between average_cost and the option to book a table. We can venture that if you can book a table, 
    the restaurant will most likely be expensive.
    
**General trends from affordable restaurants**
    
    1) Most of the restaurants do not offer online order (60.5%).
    2) The top 3 preferred cuisines are: South Indian, Modern Indian, North Indian.
    3) The top 3 locations are: BTM, Brigade road, Malleshwaram.
    4) The top 3 offered dishes are: chicken, pizza & pasta/ & The drinks: cocktails & mocktails.
    
**Trends from expensive restaurants** (the sample is pretty small to generalize)

    1) Do not offer online order.
    2) They offer the possibility of booking a table.
    3) Cuisines: thai, mangalorean & italian.

**Recommendations to open a new restaurant**

There are more affordable restaurants than expensive ones, this says a lot about the preferences about habitants in Bangalore, this is why I would go for an affordable restaurant:

    a) Chains are popular, so if the first restaurant goes well then I would invest in turning it into a chain.
    b) Offer online order - it could be a differential added value. 
    c) Cuisine: there are no good cheap Chinese or Biryani restaurants.
    d) Location: there are no good cheap restaurants in Koramangala 4th Block, Jayanagar, Koramangala 7th Block or Koramangala 5th Block.
