# Best-restaurants-in-Bangalore

This project is an example of exploratory data analysis, working with [a dataset from Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/himanshupoddar/zomato-bangalore-restaurants).

My business case was: "What do successful restaurants in Bangalore have in common?"
In order to determine that I researched the general trends from highly rated restaurants (cheap and expensive ones).
Did they offered online order? Where were they located? Which food did they offered? What is their cost?

These were my conclusions:

**General trends from the restaurants**

    1) Most of the restaurants offer online order (59%)
    2) The majority of restaurants do not offer the possibility to book a table (87.5%)
    3) Almost 50% of restaurants has rating between 3 and 4.
    4) Restaurants having rating more than 4.5 are very rare.
    5) The top 5 preferred cuisines are: North Indian, Chinese, South Indian & Biryani
    6) The average cost for 2 pax is 555. Which means that there are more cheap restaurants than expensive ones.
    7) The top 5 neighborhoods with restaurants are: BTM, Koramangala 7th, 5th, 4th & 6th Block
    8) It looks like there is a moderate correlation between average_cost and rates and votes. 
    There is a strong correlation between average_cost and the option to book a table. We can venture that if you can book a table, 
    the restaurant will most likely be expensive.
    
**General trends from cheap restaurants**
    
    1) Most of the restaurants do not offer online order (60.5%).
    2) The top 3 preferred cuisines are: South Indian, Modern Indian, North Indian.
    3) The top 3 locations are: BTM, Brigade road, Malleshwaram.
    4) The top 3 offered dishes are: chicken, pizza & pasta/ & The drinks: cocktails & mocktails.
    
**Trends from expensive restaurants** (the sample is pretty small to generalize)

    1) Do not offer online order.
    2) They offer the possibility of booking a table.
    3) Cuisines: thai, mangalorean & italian.

**Recommendations to open a new restaurant**

There are more cheap/affordable restaurants than expensive ones, this says a lot about the preferences about habitants in Bangalore, this is why I would go for an affordable restaurant:
        a) Chains are popular, so if the first restaurant goes well then I would invest in turning it into a chain
        b) Offer online order - as it is a differential added value
        c) Cuisine: there are no good cheap Chinese or Biryani restaurants
        d) Location: there are no good cheap restaurants in Koramangala 4th Block, Jayanagar, Koramangala 7th Block, Koramangala 5th Block
